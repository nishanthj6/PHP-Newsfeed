## Introduction
This is a simple newsfeed made in PHP.
The code uses a template filesystem image, where it actually do not have its engine yet
following the standards of an usual template system.

Below you will find instructions on how to get this installed on your system.
Please do be sure to have the requirements fullfiled!

You will find details and instructions on how to achieve each requirement below the list.

**Local Database**

By using any of the webservers above, you will by default get a local webserver installed.
If your webserver is a fresh install, you can verify this by visiting your PHPMyAdmin.

For Windows users:

 > **Note:** It's recommended to use WinRaR for the zip, but any zipreader works.

Once downloaded, extract the content in your htdocs folder.
C:\XAMPP\HTDOCS (Windows) or /var/www (Linux)

Navigating to your newsfeed using localhost in your browser will now get you to an install page.
Simply enter the database credentials there. If nothing happends, your credentials might be wrong.

**GIT**

Navigate to your webserver htdocs directory, XAMPP/htdocs/ for windows or /var/www/ for Mac users, using the command prompt. Once there, clone the repository using git clone.

Navigating to your newsfeed using localhost in your browser will now get you to an install page.
Simply enter the database credentials there. If nothing happends, your credentials might be wrong.

## The Developers Last Words
Both the code and design could indeed be optimized, at many places.
Due to lack of time however, this was skipped for now. Hopefully one day I manage to create a full template system aswell and not only an image of it like here.
